LM Studio is an easy-to-use desktop application for experimenting with local and open-source large language models (LLMs), enabling better local deployment of large models with relatively simple operations.

Installing LM Studio is very simple. Just visit the LM Studio [official website](https://lmstudio.ai/).

Install the version according to your computer's operating system.

After downloading, open the LM Studio software and search for "yi1.5-6b-chat" or other models in the search bar. The following example uses "yi1.5-6b-chat".

LM Studio will helpfully assess which models your local computer can run, which can effectively avoid memory issues.
