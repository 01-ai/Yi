# 「Yi x LlamaIndex」 Building an Intelligent Q&A System Integrating Network and Local Knowledge Based on LlamaIndex and Yi-large

## 1. Introduction

In today's rapidly developing artificial intelligence landscape, large language models (LLMs) have become the core of numerous applications. However, LLMs also face challenges such as potentially outdated information and lack of in-depth knowledge in specialized fields. To address these issues, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has emerged.

RAG significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of content by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers, and using this information to guide the generation process. This article will detail how to use LlamaIndex and the Yi-large model to build an intelligent Q&A system that integrates network documents and local knowledge bases.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

### 2.1 Yi-large Model

Yi-large is an advanced large language model developed by 01.AI, with powerful natural language understanding and generation capabilities. It can handle various complex language tasks, providing a reliable foundation for our RAG system.

### 2.2 LlamaIndex Framework

LlamaIndex is a powerful data framework designed specifically for LLM applications. It provides rich tools and abstractions, greatly simplifying the process of building RAG systems. LlamaIndex supports multiple data source integration, efficient index construction, and query optimization, making it an ideal choice for achieving our goals.

### 2.3 BGE Embedding

BGE (BAAI General Embedding) is a general-purpose text embedding model developed by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). In this project, we use BGE-base-en-v1.5 as the embedding model, which can convert text into high-quality vector representations, laying a solid foundation for subsequent similarity retrieval.

## 3. Environment Configuration and Dependency Installation

First, we need to install the necessary dependency libraries. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:

```shell
pip install llama-index
pip install llama-index-llms-yi
pip install llama-index-core llama-index-readers-file llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
```

## 4. System Implementation Steps

Let's implement this intelligent Q&A system following these steps:

### 4.1 Import Necessary Modules

```python
from llama_index.llms.yi import Yi
from llama_index.readers.web import SimpleWebPageReader
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, Settings
```

### 4.2 Configure Yi-large Model and BGE Embedding

```python
llm = Yi(model="yi-large", api_key="your_api_key")
Settings.llm = llm
Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(
    model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"
)
```

Note: You need to obtain an API key from the [01.AI platform](https://platform.01.ai/).

### 4.3 Load Network Documents and Local Knowledge Base

```python
documents_web = SimpleWebPageReader(html_to_text=True).load_data(
    ["https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/use_cases/q_and_a/"]
)
documents_loc = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
documents = documents_web + documents_loc
```

### 4.4 Build Index and Query Engine

```python
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
```

### 4.5 Implement Interactive Q&A Loop

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("User>> ")
    response = query_engine.query(user_input)
    print('Yi-large>>', response)
```

### 4.6 Let's Test It

```shell
user>>Can llama-index query data in SQL and CSV?
```
```shell
Yi-large>> Yes, llama-index can query data in SQL and CSV formats.
It supports text-to-SQL operations for querying SQL databases and 
text-to-Pandas operations for working with CSV files. This allows 
users to interact with structured data sources using natural language
queries, making it easier to extract information from these types of data.
```
```shell
user>>I want to use the Yi-large model in python, what code do I need?
```
```shell
Yi-large>> To use the Yi-large model in Python, you can use the following code as a guide. This code snippet demonstrates how to set up the OpenAI SDK to work with the Yi-large model:

```python
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

API_BASE = "https://api.01.ai/v1"
API_KEY = "your key"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=API_KEY,
    base_url=API_BASE
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="yi-large",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, who are you?"}]
)

print(completion)
```

Make sure to replace `"your key"` with your actual API key. This code will send a request to the Yi-large model with the message "Hi, who are you?" and print the response.

## 5. System Features and Advantages

1. **Knowledge Integration**: By accessing both network documents and local knowledge bases simultaneously, the system can utilize broader and more up-to-date information sources.
2. **Efficient Retrieval**: Leveraging the advantages of the LlamaIndex framework and BGE embedding model with vector indexing, it achieves fast and precise location of relevant information.
3. **Powerful Generation Capability**: The Yi-large model ensures high-quality natural language understanding and generation.
4. **Flexible Scalability**: Based on the LlamaIndex framework, the system is easy to expand and customize, allowing for the addition of more features as needed.
5. **Real-time Updates**: Through dynamic loading of network documents, the system can obtain the latest information, maintaining the timeliness of knowledge.

## 6. Application Scenarios

- **Customer Service**: Quickly answer customer inquiries and provide accurate, up-to-date product information.
- **Educational Support**: Combine textbook content with online resources to provide comprehensive learning support for students.
- **Research Assistant**: Integrate academic literature and latest research progress to assist researchers in literature reviews.
- **Technical Support**: Combine product documentation and online forum information to provide comprehensive technical solutions for users.

## 7. Conclusion

By combining LlamaIndex, Yi-large, and BGE embedding, we have built a powerful RAG system capable of seamlessly integrating network and local knowledge to provide accurate and relevant answers to users. This approach not only significantly improves the quality of responses but also greatly enhances the system's adaptability and scalability.

In practical applications, developers can adjust knowledge sources, optimize retrieval strategies, and even integrate more external tools based on specific needs to create smarter and more professional Q&A assistants. As technology continues to advance, we believe that such systems will play an increasingly important role in various fields, providing strong support for human knowledge acquisition and decision-making.
