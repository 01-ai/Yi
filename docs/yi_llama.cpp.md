# Run Yi with llama.cpp

If you have limited resources, you can try [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [ollama.cpp](https://ollama.ai/) (especially for Chinese users) to run Yi models in a few minutes locally.

This tutorial guides you through every step of running a quantized model ([yi-chat-6B-2bits](https://huggingface.co/XeIaso/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/tree/main)) locally and then performing inference.

- [Step 0: Prerequisites](#step-0-prerequisites)
- [Step 1: Download llama.cpp](#step-1-download-llamacpp)
- [Step 2: Download Yi model](#step-2-download-yi-model)
- [Step 3: Perform inference](#step-3-perform-inference)

## Step 0: Prerequisites 

- This tutorial assumes you use a MacBook Pro with 16GB of memory and an Apple M2 Pro chip.
  
- Make sure [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.com/) is installed on your machine.
  
## Step 1: Download `llama.cpp`

To clone the [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) repository, run the following command.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
```

## Step 2: Download Yi model

2.1 To clone [XeIaso/yi-chat-6B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/XeIaso/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/tree/main) with just pointers, run the following command.

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://huggingface.co/XeIaso/yi-chat-6B-GGUF
```

2.2 To download a quantized Yi model ([yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf](https://huggingface.co/XeIaso/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/blob/main/yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf)), run the following command.

```bash
git-lfs pull --include yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf
```

## Step 3: Perform inference

To perform inference with the Yi model, you can use one of the following methods.

- [Method 1: Perform inference in terminal](#method-1-perform-inference-in-terminal)
  
- [Method 2: Perform inference in web](#method-2-perform-inference-in-web)

### Method 1: Perform inference in terminal

To compile `llama.cpp` using 4 threads and then conduct inference, navigate to the `llama.cpp` directory, and run the following command.

> ### Tips
> 
> - Replace `/Users/yu/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf` with the actual path of your model.
>
> - By default, the model operates in completion mode.
> 
> - For additional output customization options (for example, system prompt, temperature, repetition penalty, etc.), run `./main -h` to check detailed descriptions and usage.

```bash
make -j4 && ./main -m /Users/yu/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf -p "How do you feed your pet fox? Please answer this question in 6 simple steps:\nStep 1:" -n 384 -e

...

How do you feed your pet fox? Please answer this question in 6 simple steps:

Step 1: Select the appropriate food for your pet fox. You should choose high-quality, balanced prey items that are suitable for their unique dietary needs. These could include live or frozen mice, rats, pigeons, or other small mammals, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.

Step 2: Feed your pet fox once or twice a day, depending on the species and its individual preferences. Always ensure that they have access to fresh water throughout the day.

Step 3: Provide an appropriate environment for your pet fox. Ensure it has a comfortable place to rest, plenty of space to move around, and opportunities to play and exercise.

Step 4: Socialize your pet with other animals if possible. Interactions with other creatures can help them develop social skills and prevent boredom or stress.

Step 5: Regularly check for signs of illness or discomfort in your fox. Be prepared to provide veterinary care as needed, especially for common issues such as parasites, dental health problems, or infections.

Step 6: Educate yourself about the needs of your pet fox and be aware of any potential risks or concerns that could affect their well-being. Regularly consult with a veterinarian to ensure you are providing the best care.

Now you have successfully asked a question to the Yi model and got an answer! ðŸ¥³

### Method 2: Perform inference in web

1. To initialize a lightweight and swift chatbot, navigate to the `llama.cpp` directory, and run the following command.

    ```bash
    ./server --ctx-size 2048 --host 0.0.0.0 --n-gpu-layers 64 --model /Users/yu/yi-chat-6B-GGUF/yi-chat-6b.Q2_K.gguf
    ```

    Then you can get an output like this:


    ```bash
    ...

    llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx      = 2048
    llama_new_context_with_model: freq_base  = 5000000.0
