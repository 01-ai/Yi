While benchmarking open-source models, we have observed a disparity between the
results generated by our pipeline and those reported in public sources (e.g.
OpenCompass). Upon conducting a more in-depth investigation of this difference,
we have discovered that various models may employ different prompts,
post-processing strategies, and sampling techniques, potentially resulting in
significant variations in the outcomes. Our prompt and post-processing strategy
remains consistent with the original benchmark, and greedy decoding is employed
during evaluation without any post-processing for the generated content. For
scores that were not reported by the original authors (including scores reported
with different settings), we try to get results with our pipeline.

To evaluate the model's capability extensively, we adopted the methodology
outlined in Llama2. Specifically, we included PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande,
ARC, OBQA, and CSQA to assess common sense reasoning. SquAD, QuAC, and BoolQ
were incorporated to evaluate reading comprehension. CSQA was exclusively tested
using a 7-shot setup, while all other tests were conducted with a 0-shot
configuration. Additionally, we introduced GSM8K (8-shot@1), MATH (4-shot@1),
HumanEval (0-shot@1), and MBPP (3-shot@1) under the category "Math & Code". Due
to technical constraints, we did not test Falcon-180 on QuAC and OBQA; the score
is derived by averaging the scores on the remaining tasks. Since the scores for
these two tasks are generally lower than the average, we believe that
Falcon-180B's performance was not underestimated.

## Usage

Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/01-ai/Yi/issues/new) if you
encounter any problem when using the **Yi** series models.

### 1. Prepare development environment

#### 1.1 Docker
The best approach to try the **Yi** series models is through Docker with GPUs. We
provide the following docker images to help you get started.

- `registry.lingyiwanwu.com/ci/01-ai/yi:latest`
- `ghcr.io/01-ai/yi:latest`

Note that the `latest` tag always points to the latest code in the `main`
branch. To test a stable version, please replace it with a specific
[tag](https://github.com/01-ai/Yi/tags).

#### 1.2 Local development environment
We use [`conda-lock`](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) to generate fully reproducible lock files for conda environments. You can refer to [conda-lock.yml](./conda-lock.yml) for the exact versions of the dependencies. Additionally, we utilize [`micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) for installing these dependencies.

To install the dependencies, please follow these steps:
1. Install `micromamba` by following the instructions available [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html).
2. Execute `micromamba install -y -n yi -f conda-lock.yml` to create a conda environment named `yi` and install the necessary dependencies.

### 2. Download the model (optional)

By default, the model weights and tokenizer will be downloaded from
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/01-ai) automatically in the next step. You
can also download them manually from the following places:

- [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/01ai/)
- [WiseModel](https://wisemodel.cn/models) (Search for `Yi`)
- Mirror site (remember to extract the content with `tar`)
  - [Yi-6B.tar](https://storage.lingyiwanwu.com/yi/models/Yi-6B.tar)
  - [Yi-6B-200K.tar](https://storage.lingyiwanwu.com/yi/models/Yi-6B-200K.tar)
  - [Yi-34B.tar](https://storage.lingyiwanwu.com/yi/models/Yi-34B.tar)
  - [Yi-34B-200K.tar](https://storage.lingyiwanwu.com/yi/models/Yi-34B-200K.tar)

### 3. Examples

#### 3.1 Use the base model

```bash
python demo/text_generation.py
```

To reuse the downloaded models in the previous step, you can provide the extra
`--model` argument:

```bash
python demo/text_generation.py  --model /path/to/model
```

Or if you'd like to get your hands dirty:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("01-ai/Yi-34B", device_map="auto", torch_dtype="auto", trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("01-ai/Yi-34B", trust_remote_code=True)
inputs = tokenizer("There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also", return_tensors="pt")
max_length = 256

outputs = model.generate(
    inputs.input_ids.cuda(),
    max_length=max_length,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    do_sample=True,
    repetition_penalty=1.3,
    no_repeat_ngram_size=5,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=40,
    top_p=0.8,
)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

<summary>Output</summary>

**Prompt**: There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also

**Generation**: There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also of great danger. A place where the very air you breathe could kill you. A place where the only way to survive is to be prepared.
The place is called the Arctic.
The Arctic is a vast, frozen wilderness. It is a place of extremes. The temperatures can drop to -40 degrees Celsius. The winds can reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour. The sun can shine for 24 hours a day, or not at all for weeks on end.
The Arctic is also a place of great beauty. The ice and snow are a pristine white. The sky is a deep blue. The sunsets are spectacular.
But the Arctic is also a place of great danger. The ice can be treacherous. The winds can be deadly. The sun can be blinding.

#### 3.2 Finetuning from the base model:

```bash
bash finetune/scripts/run_sft_Yi_6b.sh
```

Once finished, you can compare the finetuned model and the base model with the following command:

```bash
bash finetune/scripts/run_eval.sh
```
